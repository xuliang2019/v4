- Conducted quantitative equity research to identify investment opportunities and presented to senior investment committee.
- Built time series models using machine learning techniques including ARIMA, GARCH, LSTM and RNN to provide stock price
  prediction; applied weak-form efficiency test with considerations of seasonality, sector exposure and economic indices.
- Designed a new performance measurement and attribution process that supports investment strategies and different trading desks. The new process not only integrates with portfolio management process but also facilitates client write-up of
  investment strategies and the resulting outcomes. This effort has been well received by the investment team.
